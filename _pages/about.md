I am a third-year PhD student in [Operations Management and Statistics](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/programs/phd-program/major-areas-of-study/opm-accordions/) at the University of Toronto, Rotman School of Management, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Azarakhsh Malekian](https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/22380-azarakhsh-malekian) and [Ming Hu](https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/21567-ming-hu). I am interested in the role of uncertainty in markets from both the supply and demand perspectives. In particular, I study how buyers' uncertainty affects mechanism design and how limited price experimentation impacts pricing decisions. Before Rotman, I achieved a master's degree in Applied Mathematics and a bachelor's in Mathematics and Applications from Sharif University of Technology, Iran.
